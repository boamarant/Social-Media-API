# Social Media API Project

## Description

This project was completed for the Columbia Coding Bootcamp. The purpose of this project was to create a social network API that features routes for the creation, updating, and deletion of users, thoughts, and reactions, as well as the functionality to add friends. Using Insomnia, MongoDB, and Mongoose, you can use the application to play around with the routes and test out the different functionality.

## Installation

Download the application from this GitHub page and user a program like Insomnia or Postman to test the routes.

## Usage

Using your command terminal, install dependencies for express.js and mongoose. Navigate to this project and run node server.js to start the server, and use Insomnia or Postman to test routes, as outlined in the routes folder of the project.

## Credits

I referenced previous projects and examples from the Columbia University Coding Bootcamp to assist in creating this page.

## Features

The application allows the creation, updating, and deleting of users, thoughts, and reactions, similar to a regular social media platform. There is also a feature for adding and removing friends. This application, in its current state, only contains backend functionality and needs to use a program like Insomnia or Postman for testing different routes.
